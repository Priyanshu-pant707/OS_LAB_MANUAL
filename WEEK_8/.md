# Memory allocation problem :

- suppose system has free memory blocks :

| Block No | Size (KB) |
| -------- | --------- |
| 1        | 100       |
| 2        | 500       |
| 3        | 200       |
| 4        | 300       |
| 5        | 600       |


- and there are some process which required memory :

| Process | Size (KB) |
| ------- | --------- |
| P1      | 212       |
| P2      | 417       |
| P3      | 112       |
| P4      | 426       |

- ab question ye h ki kona process kis block mai jayega ?
- we can decide it by using first fit, best fit and worst fit algorithms.


# Allocation techniques :

1. ***First Fit***
 - left to right first suitable block (greater than or equal to size)
 - allocate the first block which is greater aur equal to the size required by the process 

## Advantages :
 -  fast (minimum search)
 - less overhead 
## Disadvantages :
 - fragmentation (small bloack will remian unused).

2. ***Best Fit***
 -  allocate the process into the smallest block which is enough for it's requirement.

## Advantages :
 - Efficient use of memory.
 - Less wasted space

## Disadvantages :
 - slower (must search whole list )
 - May leaver many very small unusable block of memory (memory block).

3. ***Worst Fit***
 -  allocate the process into the biggest available memory block

## Advantages :
 - Leaves larger leftover spaces
 - may reduce fragmentation initally

## Disadvantages :
 -  wastes space
 - Not efficient for long-term use.




```
note :  kisi bhi process ko ek memory block pura nhi milta h jitne uski requirement hoti h utna hi milta h aur memory block mai se utni hi memory space kam hojate for the other process.
